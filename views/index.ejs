        <h2>About this Site</h2>
        <p>This website was made for the final project of my high school programming class. In an effort to learn HTML,
            the class has been
            making websites using a combination of the text editor VScode and the website hosting service Github. We've
            also been using CSS to style the website.</p>
        <div class="aboutTest">
            <h3>About Test Page</h3>
            <p>The <a href="index_test.html">Test Page</a> is made for testing HTML code for class. It will change based
                on the assignement we are
                completing
                at the time. If you navigate to the test page, please be warned that it does not line to the same style
                sheet as the rest of the site, nor does it have a way to navigate between pages. Hit the back arrow in
                your
                browser to navigate away from it and back to the rest of the site.</p>
